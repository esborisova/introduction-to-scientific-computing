# Lesson 6: Control Flow #

__Control flow__

Control flow is the order in which the individual python statement, expression and function call are evaluated. Explicit control flow is a feature of imperative progamming languages, like Python, in contrast to declarative programming languages (e.g., SQL). A control statement in Python enable the program to _make a decision_ and follow one execution path instead of another. Control flow ensures that your Python program can follow multiple paths (bifurcate, repeat, bypass), instead of just a linear execution.

## Lesson 6.1: Branching with Boolean Values ##

* Boolean errors

```py
>>> spock = True
>>> spock
True
>>> true
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'true' is not defined
>>>
>>> True = 2+2
  File "<stdin>", line 1
SyntaxError: can't assign to keyword
```

| Operator | Meaning |
| - | - |
| `==` | equal to|
| `!=` | not equal to|
| `<` | less than |
| `>` | greater than |
| `<=` | less than or equal to |
| `>=` | greater than or equal to |

* Boolean integer tests

```py
>>> 23 == 23
True
>>> 23 == 5
False
>>> 2 != 3
True
>>> 5 != 5
False
```

* String and float tests

```py
>>> 'spock' == 'spock'
True
>>> 'spock' == 'Spock'
False
>>> 'spock' != 'kirk'
True
>>> False == False
True
>>> 23.0 == 23
True
>>> 23 == '23'
```

* leg/geq

```py
>>> 5 < 23
True
>>> 5 > 23
False
>>> 23 < 23
False
>>> spock = 25
>>> spock <= 25
True
>>> kirk = 24
>>> kirk >= 10
True
```

variable assignment vs. equality test

* `==` operator compares two values
* `=` operator assigns a value to a variable

### Boolean operators ###

Boolean operators (NOT/AND/OR) compare Boolean values/expressions (True/False).

Negation, NOT/$\lnot$

| Expression | not `True` | not `False` |
| - | :-: | :-: |
| Evaluates to...  | __F__ | __T__ |

```py
>>> A = True
>>> not A
False
>>> B = False
>>> not B
True
>>> not not B
False
```

Conjunction, AND/$\land$

| Expression | `True` and `True` | `True` and `False` | `False` and `True` | `False` and `False` |
| - | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Evaluates to...  | __T__ | __F__ | __F__ | __F__ |

```py
>>> A = True
>>> A and A
True
>>> B = False
>>> A and B
False
>>> B and A
False
>>> B and B
False
```

Disjunction, OR/$\lor$

| Expression | `True` or `True` | `True` or `False` | `False` or `True` | `False` or `False` |
| - | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Evaluates to...  | __T__ | __T__ | __T__ | __F__ |

```py
>>> A = True
>>> A or A
True
>>> B = False
>>> A or B
True
>>> B or A
True
>>> B or B
False
```


#### Mixing Boolean and Comparison Operators ####

```py
>>> (0 < 1) and (1 < 2)
True
>>> (0 < 1) and (2 < 1)
False
>>> (0 == 1) or (1 == 1)
True
>>> ()
```

#### Examples ####

What is the largest number?

```py
x = 1
y = 3
z = 2
if (x > y) and (x > z):
    print("x is larger than y and z")
elif (y > x) and (y > z):
    print("y is larger than x and z")
else:
    print("z is larger than x and y")
```

implement XOR (exclusive OR)

```py
>>> x = 1
>>> y = 2
>>> (x == x or y != y) and not (x == x and y != y)
True
>>> (x == x or y == y) and not (x == x and y == y)
False
```

### Elements of Flow Control ###

* condition is an expression `x > y` in the context of flow control
* blocks of code are groups of python lines
  * a block begins with an indentation (PEP8: use four spaces instead of tab)
  * blocks can be embedded in other blocks
  * a block end with iÅ„dentation decrease (four spaces/tab pr block)

```py

name = 'Kathryn'
password = 'voyager'

if name == 'Kathryn':
    print(f'Hello, {name}')
    if password == 'voyager':
        print('Please enter')
    else:
        print('Error, please try again')
```

* this is an example on program execution that starts with a CASE (`name` test) followed by a SELECTION (`if ... else`) flow where the program bifurcates.

## Lesson 6.2: Flow Control Statements ##

#### `if` statement ####

* SELECTION or CASE control flow (initial statement)

Components

* the `if` keyword
* a condition (evaluates to `True` or `False`)
* a `:`
* `if` clause: next line indented (4 spaces) code block

```py
if name == 'Kathryn':
    print(f'Hello, {name}.')
```

#### `else` statement ####

* SELECTION control flow

Components

* the `else` keyword
* a `:`
* `else` clause: next line indented (4 spaces) code block

```py
if name == 'Kathryn':
    print(f'Hello, {name}.')
else:
    print('Hello, who are you?')
```

#### `elif` statement ####

CASE flow control

Components

* `elif` keyword
* a condition (evaluates to `True` or `False`)
* a `:`
* `elif` clause: next line indented (4 spaces) code block

```py
if name == 'Kathryn':
    print(f'Hello, {name}.')
elif name == 'Seven of Nine':
    print(f'Hello, {name}, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero O')
```

* add additional CASEs

```py
if name == 'Kathryn':
    print(f'Hello, {name}.')
elif name == 'Seven of Nine':
    print(f'Hello, {name}, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero O')
elif name == 'Kirk':
    print('You don't belong here')
```

* close with a SELECTION

```py
if name == 'Kathryn':
    print(f'Hello, {name}.')
elif name == 'Seven of Nine':
    print(f'Hello, {name}, Tertiary Adjunct of Unimatrix Zero O')
elif name == 'Kirk':
    print('You don't belong here')
else:
    print('Hello, who are you?')
```

## `while` loop statement ##

Components

* the `while` keyword
* a condition (evaluates to `True` or `False`)
* a `:`
* `while` clause: next line indented (4 spaces) code block

Compare `if` to `while`

```py
>>> if var < 5:
...     print('foobar')
...     var = var + 1
...
foobar
```

```py
>>> var = 0
>>> while var < 5:
...     print('foobar')
...     var = var + 1
...
foobar
foobar
foobar
foobar
foobar
```

make script and try (annoying) while loop

```py
name = ''
while name != 'exit':
    print('Enter your name')
    name = input()
    if name != 'exit':
        print(f'well hello {name}')
print('Thank you')
```

* caught in infinite loop

```py
while True:
    print('in the loop...')
```

* exit with `Ctrl + c` or `CMD + c`


#### `break` statement ####

* use onside loop

```py
while True:
    print('Enter your name')
    name = input()
    if name == 'exit':
        break
    print(f'well hello {name}')
print('Thank you')
```

#### `continue` statement ####

* use onside loop

```py
while True:
    print('Your name please:')
    name = input()
    if name != 'Spock':
        continue
    print(f'Hello {name}. What is the password? (It is borg)')
    password = input()
    if password == 'borg':
        print(f'Ok {name}, you are in the clear')
        break
```

#### Truety or Falsey values ####

```py
>>> 0 == False
True
>>>  0.0 == False
True
```

```py
>>> test = ''
>>> if test:
        print('test successful')
>>> test = 'something'
>>> if test:
        print('test successful')
test successful
```

#### `for` loops and `range()` ####

Components

* the `for` keyword
* a (loop) variable name
* the `in` keyword
* a call to the `range()` function with up to three parameters (integers)
* a `:`
* `for` clause: next line indented (4 spaces) code block

```py
>>> print('How are you')
>>> for i in range(5):
...     print(f'good * {i}')
good * 0
good * 1
good * 2
good * 3
good * 4
```

NB: remember that `break` and `continue` statements can be used inside loops

* summing consecutive values

```py
total_sum = 0
for num in range(101):
    total_sum = total_sum + num
print(total_sum)

5050
```

* implement consecutive sum with `while` statement

```py
total_sum = 0
num = 0
while num < 101:
    total_sum = total_sum + num
    num = num + 1 
print(total_sum)
```

##### Parameters of `range()` #####

* `range()` is inclusive in the beginning, but exclusive in the end

```py
for i in range(12, 18, 2):
    print(i)
12
14
16
```

* backwards

```py
for i in range(3, -1, -1):
    print(i)
3
2
1
0
```

## Lesson 6.3: Tidying up and Detecting Problems ##

Returning to our inflammation data, we can now create a function, `visualize()` for visualization of a data set, iterate over the data sets with a `for` loop, and create another function, `detect_problems`, that makes a decision based on the data set's extrema.

We start by importing our dependencies

```py
import numpy as np
import matplotli.pyplot as plt
import glob
```

Then we write the visualization function

```py
def visualize(filename):

    data = np.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10.0, 3.0))

    axes1 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 1)
    axes2 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 2)
    axes3 = fig.add_subplot(1, 3, 3)

    axes1.set_ylabel('average')
    axes1.plot(np.mean(data, axis=0))

    axes2.set_ylabel('max')
    axes2.plot(np.max(data, axis=0))

    axes3.set_ylabel('min')
    axes3.plot(np.min(data, axis=0))

    fig.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
```

And the detection function

```py
def detect_problems(filename):
   
    data = np.loadtxt(fname=filename, delimiter=',')

    if np.max(data, axis=0)[0] == 0 and np.max(data, axis=0)[20] == 20:
        print('Suspicious looking maxima!')
    elif np.sum(np.min(data, axis=0)) == 0:
        print('Minima add up to zero!')
    else:
        print('Seems OK!')

```

Did we forget the `return` statement? In Python, functions are not required to include a `return` statement and can be used for the sole purpose of grouping together pieces of code that conceptually do one thing. In such cases, function names usually describe what they do, e.g. visualize, detect_problems.

Notice how _modularity_ avoid jumbling the code together in one giant `for` loop. instead we can read and reuse seperately. We can reproduce the previous analysis with a much simpler `for` loop:

```py
filenames = sorted(glob.glob('inflammation*.csv'))

for filename in filenames[:3]:
    print(f'Reading: {filename}')
    visualize(filename)
    detect_problems(filename)
```

If we had separated the code in different (modular) files, the last block would have been called the _driver_. By giving our functions human-readable names, we can more easily read and understand what is happening in the for loop. Even better, if at some later date we want to use either of those pieces of code again, we can do so in a single line.
